        <h1>Why does the priest cover his hands when lifting up the Monstrance at adoration?</h1>
        <p>Non-Catholic Christians cannot receive the Eucharist because it is a gift that must be 
            freely accepted. God offers many blessings and gifts but never forces them upon anyone. 
            Since he sees more than just words, but also minds and hearts, he can tell if you truly 
            desire the gift you are asking for. Indeed, the first step to truly desiring something is 
            to know what that something is, and a non-Catholic almost certainly has an incomplete 
            understanding. Thus, a non-Catholic cannot accept the Eucharist as a gift in good faith. 
            On another note, even if a non-Catholic claimed to truly believe that the Eucharist was 
            the body of Christ, that begs the question: why are they not Catholic? In order to 
            believe that a host consecrated by a priest has truly become Jesus, one must believe that 
            the priest has valid authority granted by the church. And if one believes in the church, 
            why are they not Catholic? Thus, the only way to receive the Eucharist is to be a 
            practicing Catholic.</p>
