        <h1>Why does the priest cover his hands when lifting up the Monstrance at adoration?</h1>
        <p>Personally, I had always wondered why the priest covered his hands. After all, if he was 
            not supposed to touch the monstrance, why would he touch it with his hands to set it up 
            and remove the luna (the little disk that holds the host)? The answer lies not within the 
            touch but within the sight. Many Catholic rituals have symbolism designed to help get the 
            right point across. In this case, the priest covers his hands and wears the humeral veil 
            not to avoid touching the monstrance but to minimize how much of himself is visible. The 
            objective is for the eyes and minds of the people gathered to focus on the Eucharist only. 
            In a sense, the priest hides himself so that Christ might be further emphasized.</p>
